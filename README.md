SpectralifyWeb is the web interface for Spectralify, an open-source project aimed at creating more equitable music recommendation algorithms that prioritize musical discovery over popularity metrics.
## Overview
While traditional music recommendation systems typically analyze only 12 components of a song, Spectralify's audio extraction tool can extract over 50 distinct musical characteristics through deep signal processing, enabling more nuanced and informative recommendations.

# Technologies Used
* React.js
* Tailwind CSS
* JavaScript/ES6+
* GitHub Pages

# Future Plans
* Integrate the Spotify Web API to pull album covers, and build playlists from similar songs.
* Ability to toggle personality-based modifiers: How you are feeling, energy levels, favorite genres, etc. All of this is in the hopes to get you your best recommendation with our spectacular data as the leading factor and your wants giving even more personalized results!
* Strengthen and refine our recommendation engine to use the data to its absolute fullest!

# NOTE!
* Spectralify Web is still in its infancy and will undergo many changes in the coming months. All that can be seen currently is for testing only and not indicative of the final product!
* Only use song data from songs that you physically own or have license to.
