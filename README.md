SpectralifyWeb is the web interface for Spectralify, an open-source project creating more equitable music recommendation algorithms that prioritize musical discovery over popularity metrics.

## ðŸŽ‰ Now Live!

Visit [SpectralifyWeb](https://luke-cutter.github.io/SpectralifyWeb/) to start discovering music based on actual musical characteristics rather than just popularity metrics. Not seeing Album Covers/ Can't save playlists? Spotify requires me to manually verify each user. Email cutterluke701@gmail.com to request access!
