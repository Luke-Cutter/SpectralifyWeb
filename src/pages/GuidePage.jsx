          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-center">Introduction to Spectralify</h3>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Spectralify is an advanced audio processing toolkit that extracts comprehensive acoustic features 
            from music files. Built on Python libraries like Librosa and NumPy, it analyzes raw audio signals 
            to generate precise quantitative measurements of musical characteristics including pitch, rhythm, 
            timbre, harmony, and dynamics.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            The toolkit processes audio at the signal level, deconstructing the complex waveforms into 
            meaningful numeric values that represent how we perceive music. For example, rather than simply 
            knowing a song is labeled "rock," Spectralify can tell you exactly how distorted the guitars are, 
            how consistent the drummer's timing is, and whether the vocalist has a wide pitch range.
          </p>
          <p>
            This sophisticated analysis enables music recommendation systems to understand the actual acoustic 
            properties that make songs sound similar or different, going far beyond traditional metadata like 
            genre tags. Spectralify provides the foundation for truly content-based music discovery, where 
            recommendations are based on the intrinsic sonic qualities of the music itself.
